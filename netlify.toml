## 🚀 **Quick Summary**

**DON'T modify `health_checker.py`** - keep it as is.

**DO create these 3 new files:**
1. `netlify/functions/health.py` 
2. `netlify/functions/test.py`
3. `netlify/functions/slack-command.py`

**Your final structure should look like:**
```
your-github-repo/
├── netlify.toml
├── requirements.txt
├── runtime.txt  
├── health_checker.py          ← Keep this (your business logic)
└── netlify/
    └── functions/
        ├── health.py          ← Create this
        ├── test.py            ← Create this
        └── slack-command.py   ← Create this
